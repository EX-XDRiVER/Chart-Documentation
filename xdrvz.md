# EX-XDRiVER Zip Format (.xdrvz)

A `.xdrvz` file is a password encrypted archive of a song folder. You can create one while [Chart Developer Mode](https://github.com/EX-XDRiVER/Chart-Documentation/blob/main/mods.md#chart-developer-mode) is enabled, and pressing `F12` over a custom song.

These files can be shared and loaded like any other custom song, but the files cannot be read or modified.
