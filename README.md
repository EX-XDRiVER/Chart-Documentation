## ⚠️ Creation and Distribution of Custom Content
- Users should only create and distribute custom content with a music artist's and illustrator's work if users have permission from the music artists and illustrators.
  - **For remixes** of songs, users must **get permission from both the original music artists and the remixers**.
  - **For collaborations**, users must **get permission from all collaborators**.
  - If any party declines the use of their work, users cannot use it. **Bootlegs should not be used for this reason.**

- <ins>**Distributing custom content without proper permission in our Discord server may result in a ban.**</ins>
  - **These rules extend to distributing media (for example, screenshots or video) with said custom content.**

- **For <ins>music artists and illustrators who want to publicly allow or deny the use of your work</ins>**, send us an email at **[contact@xdrv.team](mailto:contact@xdrv.team)**.

- **For <ins>users who want to check if a music artist or illustrator has publicly allowed or denied the use of their work</ins>**, view our **[spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1proQiFfMdWsOHJ4aqs6q88aLru0LDq-RmH7CCd0Tugk)**.

### Disclaimers
- We cannot regulate custom content outside of our Discord server, and we ask that users follow these rules.
- Users are solely responsible for the custom content they create and distribute, and own the rights to the custom content they create.
- The EX-XDRiVER team is not responsible and not liable for any custom content created by users.
