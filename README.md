## ⚠️ Custom Content Creation & Distribution Rules
- You should only create and distribute custom content with a music artist's and illustrator's work if you have permission from the music artists and illustrators.
  - If an artist releases their music or illustration under a [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) license or belongs in the Public Domain, you may use it as long as the use of their work complies with their terms. Please verify this information before using their work. In addition, tell us where you found this information either on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/JGb4VTGTmk), or via **[email](mailto:contact@xdrv.team)**.
  - For remixes of songs, you must get permission from both the original music artists and the remixers.
  - For collaborations, you must get permission from all collaborators.
  - If any party declines the use of their work, you cannot use it. Bootlegs should not be used for this reason.

- Distributing custom content without proper permission in our Discord server may result in a ban.
  - These rules extend to distributing media (for example, screenshots or video) with said custom content.
  - Additionally, we may ask you to take down videos and downloads of said custom content.

- For music artists and illustrators who want to publicly allow or deny the use of your work, send us an email at **[contact@xdrv.team](mailto:contact@xdrv.team)**.

- For creators who want to check if a music artist or illustrator has publicly allowed or denied the use of their work, view our **[spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1proQiFfMdWsOHJ4aqs6q88aLru0LDq-RmH7CCd0Tugk)**.
