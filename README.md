## ⚠️ Custom Content Creation & Distribution Guidelines
- Creators should only create and distribute custom content with a music artist's and illustrator's work if creators have permission from the music artists and illustrators.
  - For remixes of songs, creators must get permission from both the original music artists and the remixers.
  - For collaborations, creators must get permission from all collaborators.
  - If any party declines the use of their work, creators cannot use it. Bootlegs should not be used for this reason.

- Distributing custom content without proper permission in our Discord server may result in a ban.
  - These rules extend to distributing media (for example, screenshots or video) with said custom content.

- **For music artists and illustrators who want to publicly allow or deny the use of your work, send us an email at **[contact@xdrv.team](mailto:contact@xdrv.team)**.

- For creators who want to check if a music artist or illustrator has publicly allowed or denied the use of their work, view our **[spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1proQiFfMdWsOHJ4aqs6q88aLru0LDq-RmH7CCd0Tugk)**.

### Disclaimers
- We cannot regulate custom content outside of our Discord server, and we ask that creators follow these guidelines.
- Creators are solely responsible for the custom content they create and distribute, and own the rights to the custom content they create.
- Team XDRV is not responsible and not liable for any custom content.

### Reporting Custom Content
- If you have any concerns about custom content in any way, contact us at **[contact@xdrv.team](mailto:contact@xdrv.team)**.
